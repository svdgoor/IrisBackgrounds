Thanks to all who made screenshots of Iris Creations!
## Installation

This is my recommeded installation for Windows

1. Clone this repository to any `<location>` on your PC (HDD if present).
2. Right-click your desktop and select `personalize`.
3. Under the `Backgrounds` section, select `<location>/IrisBackgrounds/images`.
4. For a single monitor, set the mode to `centre` or `fill`. For multiple, use `centre` or `fill` for multiple images or `span` for a single across all screens. These settings appear to give the best results, though feel free to try other modes.
5. Set the refresh time to anything. I personally use `1 minute`.
6. Enjoy exactly <!-- BEGIN COUNT -->`204`<!-- END COUNT --> (and counting) screenshots every time you see your desktop!

## Uploading
To contribute screenshots to this collection, each image must be
- of terrain generated by Iris Dimension Engine [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-dimension-engine.84586/) [GitHub](https://www.github.com/VolmitSoftware/Iris) (though buildings not native to Iris are allowed in the image),
- at least `1920x1080`,
- free of copyrighted material,
- of decent quality (no pixelation, no compression artifacts, etc.),

To upload your screenshots, you can:
- Make a PR with your screenshots added to the `images` folder, or
